# CSE 262: Programming Assignment 4: Scheme

In this folder, you should re-implement the two programs from previous
assignments.  The main difference is that now you need to make sure you only
use parts of Scheme that are also parts of Slang.  For example, you can't use
`let`.  These will serve as advanced test cases for your interpreter.

# CSE 262: Programming Assignment 3: Scheme

In this folder, you will find three incomplete scheme files.  Each has the shell
of a single function that you should implement.  These exercises will help you
to become more comfortable with the Scheme language.

You should comment your code, so that I understand why you chose to solve each
part of the assignment in the way you did.

It is easy to cheat on these assignments, by looking for solutions online and
then copying them.  Please don't.

In addition to needing to write **correct** code, you should also write
**efficient** code.  This manifests in two ways.  First, you should make sure
that your code is tail recursive whenever possible.  Second, you should make
sure that your code is asymptotically optimal.  It is easy to accidentally write
code with quadratic overhead (e.g., by calling an O(n) function on each
recursive call).  Be careful!
